\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{figures/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e

\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix

%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil

\section{Literature Review}


Avkhadeev evaluated delayed acknowledgment schemes in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over Wi-Fi \cite{avkhadeev_2025}. He implemented TCP-Adaptive Acknowledgment Delay (TCP-AAD) in a Linux kernel. Simulations revealed that adaptive delays based on packet inter-arrival times improve throughput. This work identified optimal delay windows to balance acknowledgment overhead and burst-induced losses.

TCP stands as the key protocol for reliable online data transfer. It ensures packets arrive correctly and in sequence. Early standards established its core principles.

\subsection{TCP Basics}

RFC 793 defines TCP's essential mechanisms \cite{rfc793}. It explains connection establishment through a three-way handshake. Senders transmit segments with sequence numbers to track order. Receivers use acknowledgments to signal successful delivery. This setup provides reliability over unreliable networks.

RFC 1122 enhances these foundations for internet hosts \cite{rfc1122}. It addresses implementation details like handling fragmented packets. The document also covers requirements for robust error detection. These refinements help TCP operate effectively in complex environments.

\subsection{Congestion Management}

Excess traffic can overwhelm networks. RFC 896 introduced congestion control concepts in IP/TCP systems \cite{rfc896}. It described scenarios where unchecked growth leads to collapse. The memo emphasized the need for senders to react to network signals.

Modern TCP employs specific algorithms to manage load. RFC 5681 specifies slow start to gradually increase sending rates \cite{rfc5681}. Congestion avoidance follows to maintain steady flow. Fast retransmit and recovery handle detected losses quickly. These methods prevent persistent overload.

RFC 2018 introduces selective acknowledgments (SACK) \cite{rfc2018}. This option lets receivers specify received segments precisely. Senders can retransmit only missing parts. SACK improves efficiency during bursts of losses.

CUBIC targets high-bandwidth, long-delay paths. RFC 8312 outlines its cubic function for window growth \cite{rfc8312}. This approach achieves better scalability than traditional linear methods. CUBIC maintains stability while probing for available capacity.

\subsection{High-Performance Additions}

Paths with large bandwidth-delay products require expanded capabilities. RFC 7323 defines the window scale option to support bigger receive windows \cite{rfc7323}. It also introduces timestamps for accurate round-trip time measurement. Timestamps enable protection against wrapped sequence numbers in fast networks.

These extensions allow TCP to utilize high-speed links fully. Larger windows prevent underuse of capacity. Timestamps aid in distinguishing old duplicates from new data.

\subsection{Wireless Issues}

Wireless environments pose unique challenges. Links suffer from bit errors and interference. Balakrishnan et al. evaluated techniques to boost TCP over wireless \cite{balakrishnan_1997}. They compared end-to-end, link-layer, and split-connection approaches. Link-layer retransmissions proved effective in hiding losses from TCP.

Xylomenos et al. provided an overview of TCP/IP performance in wireless networks \cite{xylomenos_2002}. They discussed how random errors trigger unnecessary congestion responses. The paper highlighted the need for adaptations to distinguish error types.

Pokhrel et al. developed a model for TCP over Wi-Fi \cite{pokhrel_2016}. It accounts for both buffer overflows and channel losses. Their analysis reveals interactions between these factors. The model predicts throughput under varying conditions.

\subsection{Delayed Acknowledgments}

Delayed acknowledgments reduce control traffic. Receivers delay responses to batch confirmations.

Altman and Jim\'enez proposed innovative delayed ACK methods for multihop wireless networks \cite{altman_2003}. They introduced variable delay coefficients based on sequence numbers. Simulations showed substantial throughput gains from ACK thinning.

Chen et al. investigated TCP with delayed ACK in wireless settings \cite{chen_2008}. They observed that unrestricted delays do not always help. Optimal window sizes depend on path lengths. Longer paths increase interference from bursty transmissions.

Avkhadeev assessed delayed acknowledgment schemes over Wi-Fi \cite{avkhadeev_2025}. He implemented TCP-AAD in a Linux kernel. The work evaluated performance through simulations. Results indicated adaptive delays improve throughput in various scenarios.

\subsection{Wi-Fi Advances}

IEEE 802.11n introduced enhancements for higher throughput. Xiao described features like MIMO and channel bonding \cite{xiao_2005}. MIMO uses multiple antennas to increase data rates. Bonding combines channels for wider bandwidth.

Deek et al. analyzed channel bonding's effects on 802.11n networks \cite{deek_2011}. They found wider channels boost capacity but heighten interference. The study emphasized careful management for optimal performance.

Saha et al. examined power and throughput tradeoffs in 802.11n/ac smartphones \cite{saha_2015}. Higher features like MIMO consume more energy. Their experiments highlighted balances needed for mobile devices.

\subsection{Summary of Literature}

Table \ref{table_lit_summary} summarizes the reviewed works. It lists each reference with its publication year. The table details key contributions and their ties to this thesis. Entries group into categories like fundamentals, congestion control, wireless challenges, delayed ACKs, and Wi-Fi enhancements. This structure shows the progression from basic TCP to specific Wi-Fi optimizations. The table aids quick reference to foundational and advanced sources.

This thesis extends Avkhadeev's simulation-based evaluation \cite{avkhadeev_2025}. It applies the delayed ACK scheme in real hardware setups. Tools like tc control traffic shaping. iperf measures throughput in client-server tests.

\section{Methodology}

This section describes the experimental setup, test parameters, data collection procedures, and analysis methods used to evaluate TCP-AAD performance over Wi-Fi networks.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

The experiments employ a controlled three-node topology consisting of a client, server, and wireless router. Figure~\ref{fig:topology} illustrates the network architecture.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figures/topology.pdf}
\caption{Experimental network topology. The client connects via Ethernet to perform traffic shaping with tc, while the server connects over WiFi to measure TCP performance. The router runs OpenWRT with configurable WiFi rate control.}
\label{fig:topology}
\end{figure}

The client machine connects to the network via Ethernet interface (enp7s0) at IP address 192.168.1.50. This wired connection ensures stable baseline conditions for initiating TCP flows. The client runs iperf3 in client mode to generate TCP traffic.

The server machine connects wirelessly through interface wlan0 at IP address 192.168.1.165. This placement allows direct measurement of TCP performance over the Wi-Fi link. The server executes iperf3 in server mode to receive and measure incoming traffic on port 5201.

The wireless router operates at IP address 192.168.1.1. It runs an OpenWRT-based firmware that provides fine-grained control over Wi-Fi parameters. The router configuration enables manipulation of transmission rates through the mac80211 wireless subsystem.

Both client and server machines run Linux with kernel version 5.15 or later. The server can boot into two kernel variants: the standard Linux kernel or a modified kernel implementing TCP-AAD. This dual-boot capability enables direct comparison between conventional TCP behavior and the adaptive acknowledgment scheme.

\subsection{Experimental Parameters}

The experiments systematically vary multiple factors to characterize TCP-AAD performance across diverse network conditions. Table~\ref{table:parameters} summarizes the test parameters and their values.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Kernel Variants}

Tests run with two kernel configurations on the server:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Default kernel}: Standard Linux TCP implementation without modifications
\item \textbf{TCP-AAD kernel}: Modified implementation with adaptive acknowledgment delays based on packet inter-arrival times
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bandwidth Limits}

Traffic shaping controls the available bandwidth at the client interface. Four bandwidth settings capture different network capacity scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item 20 Mbps: Simulates constrained mobile or rural broadband
\item 50 Mbps: Represents moderate residential connections
\item 100 Mbps: Models high-speed residential or enterprise access
\item Unlimited (nolim): No artificial bandwidth constraint
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Network Delays}

Artificial delays emulate varying propagation times and queuing delays. Four delay configurations span typical wireless scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item 10 ms: Local area network or short-distance wireless
\item 50 ms: Regional or moderate-distance connections
\item 100 ms: Long-distance or satellite-like delays
\item No delay (nodelay): Zero added latency beyond natural propagation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Wi-Fi Transmission Rates}

The router fixes transmission rates to isolate rate adaptation effects. Twelve rate indices cover combinations of channel width and modulation coding scheme (MCS):

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{HT20 configurations}: 20 MHz channels with MCS 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14
\item \textbf{HT40 configurations}: 40 MHz channels with MCS 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14
\end{itemize}

These rates span different spatial stream counts (single and dual stream) and modulation schemes. HT20 rates range from approximately 13 to 104 Mbps, while HT40 rates extend up to 216 Mbps under ideal conditions.

\subsubsection{Iterations}

Each unique configuration runs three times to capture performance variability. Multiple iterations enable statistical analysis and identification of outliers.

The complete parameter matrix yields $2 \times 4 \times 4 \times 12 \times 3 = 1152$ total tests (2 kernels, 4 bandwidths, 4 delays, 12 rates, 3 iterations).

\subsection{Test Procedure}

An automated script orchestrates the experiment execution. The script iterates through all parameter combinations in a systematic manner.

For each configuration, the procedure follows these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Router rate configuration}: The script establishes an SSH connection to the router and sets the fixed transmission rate via the mac80211 debugfs interface. The command writes the rate index to \texttt{/sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy1/rc/fixed\_rate\_idx}.

\item \textbf{Settlement delay}: The system waits 3 seconds after setting the rate to allow the wireless interface to stabilize on the new transmission parameters.

\item \textbf{Traffic shaping application}: The script applies bandwidth limits and delays on the client's Ethernet interface using Linux Traffic Control (tc). For bandwidth limiting, it employs the Token Bucket Filter (tbf) qdisc. For delay injection, it uses the Network Emulator (netem) qdisc. When both constraints apply, the script creates a hierarchical configuration with tbf as the root and netem as a child qdisc.

\item \textbf{Pre-test metadata capture}: Before the throughput test begins, the script collects system state information including WiFi station statistics from the router, TCP socket parameters from the server, and kernel version details. This metadata aids in validating test conditions and diagnosing anomalies.

\item \textbf{Throughput measurement}: The client initiates a 30-second iperf3 TCP transfer to the server. The tool measures instantaneous and aggregate throughput, retransmission counts, and other TCP metrics. Results save in JSON format for structured parsing.

\item \textbf{Traffic shaping removal}: The script removes all tc rules from the client interface to restore normal operation.

\item \textbf{Inter-test delay}: A 5-second pause separates consecutive tests to allow TCP connections to close completely and queues to drain.
\end{enumerate}

All test outputs, including iperf3 JSON files, metadata snapshots, and execution logs, store in a hierarchical directory structure organized by kernel type and configuration parameters.

\subsection{Data Collection}

The experimental framework captures multiple data streams to enable comprehensive analysis.

\subsubsection{Throughput Metrics}

iperf3 records detailed performance statistics in JSON format. Key metrics include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bits per second}: Achieved goodput averaged over the test duration
\item \textbf{Bytes transferred}: Total payload successfully delivered
\item \textbf{Retransmissions}: Count of TCP segment retransmissions indicating packet loss
\item \textbf{Test duration}: Actual elapsed time for the transfer
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Wireless Statistics}

The router provides Wi-Fi layer information through the iw utility and debugfs interfaces:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Station dump}: Connection quality metrics including signal strength, transmission rate, and frame statistics
\item \textbf{Rate control status}: Current fixed rate index confirming correct configuration
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Transport Layer State}

The ss (socket statistics) command on the server captures TCP connection parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Congestion window (cwnd)}: Current sending window size
\item \textbf{Round-trip time (RTT)}: Smoothed and variance measurements
\item \textbf{Receiver window}: Advertised window from the client
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Test Metadata}

Each test generates a metadata file containing:

\begin{itemize}
\item Timestamp of execution
\item Kernel variant identifier
\item Configuration parameters (bandwidth, delay, rate, iteration)
\item System state snapshots
\end{itemize}

This metadata enables precise correlation between test conditions and observed performance.

\subsection{Data Analysis}

Python scripts process the collected data to extract insights and generate visualizations.

\subsubsection{Result Parsing}

The analysis pipeline begins by parsing iperf3 JSON output files. A custom parser extracts throughput, retransmission, and timing metrics from the end-of-test summaries. File naming conventions encode test parameters, allowing automatic association of results with experimental conditions.

\subsubsection{Aggregation and Statistics}

Results group by configuration tuple (bandwidth, delay, rate). For each configuration, the analysis computes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mean throughput}: Average across iterations
\item \textbf{Standard deviation}: Measure of performance variability
\item \textbf{Median throughput}: Robust central tendency metric
\item \textbf{Retransmission rate}: Average packet loss indicator
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparative Analysis}

The comparison module pairs results from TCP-AAD and default kernel tests under identical conditions. For each configuration, it calculates:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Throughput ratio}: TCP-AAD performance relative to default
\item \textbf{Absolute improvement}: Difference in Mbps
\item \textbf{Percentage gain}: Relative performance change
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Visualization}

Plotting scripts generate publication-quality figures including:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bar charts}: Throughput comparisons across rate configurations
\item \textbf{Heatmaps}: Performance across bandwidth-delay matrices
\item \textbf{Box plots}: Distribution of results showing variability
\item \textbf{Time series}: Per-second throughput evolution during tests
\end{itemize}

These visualizations facilitate identification of trends, optimal configurations, and performance boundaries.

The systematic methodology ensures reproducible measurements and enables rigorous evaluation of TCP-AAD effectiveness across the parameter space representative of real-world Wi-Fi deployments.
